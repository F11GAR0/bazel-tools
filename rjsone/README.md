# rjsone

Bazel rule for [`rjsone`](https://github.com/wryun/rjsone).

## Setup and usage via Bazel

`WORKSPACE` file:

```bzl
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:git.bzl", "git_repository")

# rjsone is written in Go and hence needs rules_go and gazelle to be built.
# See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle for the up to date setup instructions.
http_archive(
    name = "rules_go",
)

http_archive(
    name = "bazel_gazelle",
)

git_repository(
    name = "compat-bazel-tools",
    commit = "<commit>",
    remote = "https://github.com/ash2k/bazel-tools.git",
    shallow_since = "<bla>",
)

load("@compat-bazel-tools//:rjsone/deps.bzl", "rjsone_dependencies")

rjsone_dependencies()
```

`BUILD.bazel` file:

```bzl
load("@compat-bazel-tools//:rjsone/def.bzl", "rjsone")

filegroup(
    name = "list",
    srcs = [
        "context1.yaml",
        "context2.yaml",
    ],
)

rjsone(
    name = "example1",
    contexts = [
        "context1.yaml",
        "context2.yaml",
    ],
    keyed_contexts = {
        ":list": "list",
        "named.yaml": "foobar",
    },
    template = "template_bazel.yaml",
)
```

Rule has two predeclared outputs: `{name}.yaml` and `{name}.json`. You may depend on one or the other depending on
whether you want to get output as YAML or JSON.

```console
bazel build //:example1 # builds both
bazel build //:example1.yaml
bazel build //:example1.json
```

Not all rjsone features are supported right now.
